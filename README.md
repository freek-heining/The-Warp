*[The Warp](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/282775/the-warp) is a fast-paced 4X board game for 1 to 4 players (5-6 with a separate expansion, solo mode only in physical release). After 5 years of cataclysms and revolts, you take command of one of the remaining colonies on the forsaken planet Yortar. You can choose 2 of the 16 unique asymmetrical alien races and lead your colony along the path of prosperity, progress and/or conquest. You might even conquer the abandoned warp gate and find out who was behind the events that lead to the global catastrophe. On your journey you will face rival colonies, the unstable wastelands and exiled races with shifting allegiances.  
The game features 66 possible missions objectives during play, allowing players to choose their own playstyle. The core mechanisms incorporate area control, card/resource management and euro engine building. Next to a dynamic dice system, the combat system features bluffing and bribing mechanisms.*
